# Data Analytics Project Methodology

A step-by-step methodology that could be applied to this dataset, or maybe most data analytics projects, when we don’t yet have a well-defined goal.

---

## 1) Understand the Context & Brainstorm Possible Questions

- **Domain Familiarization:**  
  - Explore the e-commerce context: orders, items, sellers, reviews, deliveries, payments.  
  - Read any dataset documentation or descriptions to understand how the data was generated.

- **Potential Areas of Exploration:**  
  - **Customers:** Segment by region, behavior, purchase amount.  
  - **Sellers:** Performance, location, product variety.  
  - **Products:** Popular categories, pricing, trends over time.  
  - **Orders & Deliveries:** Delivery time analysis, factors influencing delays.  
  - **Reviews & Ratings:** Sentiment, correlation with order value or product type.

- **Narrow Down Questions/Hypotheses:**  
  - Example: “Which factors most influence customer satisfaction?”  
  - Example: “How do delivery times vary by region?”  

---

## 2) Explore & Understand the Data (Data Profiling)

- **Inventory the Data:**  
  - List the CSV files or tables (e.g., orders, order_items, customers, sellers, etc.).  
  - Understand each table’s columns (names, data types, possible joins).

- **Initial Data Exploration:**  
  - Check for missing values, outliers, overall data distribution.  
  - Compute basic descriptive stats (mean, median, stdev).  
  - Examine date columns and potential relationships.

- **Data Schema / ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram):**  
  - Visualize how orders link to items, how customers link to orders, etc.  
  - Confirm how each table references the other (e.g., `order_id`).

---

## 3) Data Cleaning & Preparation

- **Handle Missing Data:**  
  - Identify which columns have missing values.  
  - Decide whether to drop rows, impute missing data, or ignore.  

- **Correct Data Types & Formats:**  
  - Convert date columns to proper datetime format.  
  - Convert numeric strings to floats or integers.  
  - Apply categorical data types where appropriate.

- **Create Derived Columns:**  
  - Example: Delivery Duration = `delivered_date - purchase_date`.  
  - Example: Distance if lat/long are available.  
  - Example: Aggregate metrics per customer or seller.

- **Integrity Checks & Merges:**  
  - Ensure the joins between tables align (e.g., matching `order_id` exactly).  
  - Check for duplicates or inconsistent data (e.g., negative shipping durations).

---

## 4) Hypothesis Generation & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Broad Initial Explorations:**  
  - Number of orders by month/year.  
  - Average product price by category.  
  - Distribution of review scores.

- **Visualize:**  
  - Use histograms, box plots (to understand distribution and outliers).  
  - Bar charts for top categories, regions, sellers.  
  - Scatter plots for relationships (e.g., delivery time vs. review score).

- **Ask Follow-up Questions:**  
  - “Which categories have low review scores?”  
  - “Any correlation between shipping distance and on-time delivery?”

- **Refine or Add New Hypotheses:**  
  - Based on what you observe, form deeper or more focused questions.

## 5) Determine Core Objectives or Metrics

- **Establish Potential Goals:**  
  - **Predictive Goal:** Predict good vs. bad reviews.  
  - **Descriptive Goal:** Summarize buyer behavior (average spend, frequency).  
  - **Segmentation Goal:** Group customers or sellers by shared characteristics.

- **Define Key Metrics/KPIs:**  
  - Customer churn rate, average delivery delay, net promoter score approximation, etc.

---

## 6) Modeling / Analysis (If Applicable)

- **Predictive Modeling Workflow:**  
  1. Choose a target variable (e.g., review_score).  
  2. Engineer/select meaningful features.  
  3. Split data into train/test sets.  
  4. Train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
  5. Evaluate with appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1, AUC).

- **Clustering/Segmentation:**  
  1. Choose features for clustering (e.g., total orders, total spend).  
  2. Scale or normalize data as needed.  
  3. Run K-means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering.  
  4. Use silhouette scores or other means for validation and interpret clusters.

- **Descriptive-Only Analysis:**  
  - Continue in-depth EDA, correlation analysis, pivot tables, statistical tests.

---

## 7) Interpret & Validate Results

- **Check for Bias & Domain Relevance:**  
  - Do the findings make sense for e-commerce?  
  - Compare to known benchmarks or external data if possible.

- **Sanity Check:**  
  - If clustering, are the clusters distinct and explainable?  
  - If predicting review scores, are features and results sensible?

---

## 8) Present & Communicate Findings

- **Visualization & Storytelling:**  
  - Create clear charts, dashboards (e.g., shipping delay distribution, top categories).  
  - Use plain language to describe insights and connect them to real-world implications.

- **Actionable Recommendations:**  
  - If certain categories often delay deliveries, investigate supply chain for those categories.  
  - If certain regions have low review scores, evaluate logistic or marketing strategies there.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Keep notebooks or code well-organized.  
  - Document assumptions, data cleaning steps, and final conclusions.

---

## 9) Iterate

- **Data science is iterative:**  
  - Return to earlier steps as you uncover new insights.  
  - Incorporate external data sources if needed (economic or demographic data).

## Summary

1. **Context & Brainstorm:** Familiarize yourself with the dataset’s domain and outline potential questions.  
2. **Explore & Understand:** Profile the data, note missing values, outliers, and relationships.  
3. **Clean & Prepare:** Fix data types, handle missing data, engineer useful features.  
4. **EDA & Hypothesis Generation:** Visualize patterns, correlations, formulate or refine hypotheses.  
5. **Objectives & Metrics:** Decide on predictive, descriptive, or segmentation goals and relevant KPIs.  
6. **Modeling/Analysis:** Depending on your goals, implement machine learning or deeper EDA.  
7. **Interpret & Validate:** Check domain plausibility, evaluate model performance.  
8. **Communicate Results:** Present key findings visually and clearly; suggest next steps or actions.  
9. **Iterate:** Revisit earlier steps as new questions or insights surface.

This methodology transforms a broad, “no-specific-goal” exploration into a structured analytics project that can produce meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.
